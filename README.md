Welcome to my version of Match the Members! An app created for the purposes of reviewing and remembering the member names of people currently in MDB. My app comes complete with everything explicitly laid out on the spec including:

* A score counter of the number of items that one has gotten correct
* A stop/start button for the game, a countdown timer which ends after 5 seconds and triggers a completely new question
* The ability to start/stop the game by exiting or entering the Stats page
* The ability to Stop the timer on the Game page, go to the Stats page, and have the Timer still be paused
* A Stats Screen that displays:
    * Your longest streak of correct questions
    * The last three photos you were presented
        * In each instance, showing the one you chose, and the person it actually was
* After each question, the correct answer highlights to let you know who the right answer was.
* Sexy app icon that I stole directly from you guys.

You'll also notice that my app has a UITabBar, I assumed that was what was required, and apparently I assumed wrong haha. Seriously though, it gave me some good experience with creating customizable UITabBars if I'm working on an app that uses them in the future. Akkshay's explanation of UITabBarControllerDelegates was the sole reason I was capable of transferring data between the two pages. But, once he explained that to me, it was shockingly easy :).

Also I would like to dedicate this project to Sahil, who helped me debug a random issue for THIRTY MINUTES despite the fact that it seemed like he was just in the library to study. He is an infinitely kind man whom I love <3.
